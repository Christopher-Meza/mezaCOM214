This is homework assignment 2 for COM214

The index file uses parts inspired from both HTML_1 
and HTML2. I also used a style css from w3schools: (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_images_side_by_side)

The first part of the index.html is the css part that helps
align both the text with link and the images next to each
other. I originally made them one right under the other but
then I found on w3schools that my idea to put them next to
each other was better and aesthethically cleaner. The body
is what holds divs with the images and the names of the
songs with the links. After the divs it's the table that has
statistics of the songs.
